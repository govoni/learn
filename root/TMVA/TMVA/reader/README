The standalone reader class (TMVA_Reader using TMVA_ReaderTools) has been removed.
Because of the code duplication, its maintenance was too tedious and error prone.
Since the integration of TMVA within ROOT, libTMVA.so should be available through ROOT.

Please use the reader class src/Reader.h in your application. Usage examples
are provided in macros/TMVApplication.C or examples/TMVApplication.cxx.
