.SH DESCRIPTION
TMVA provides a ROOT-integrated environment for the parallel training, testing
and evaluation of sophisticated multivariate classification techniques.
The package includes:

.nf
\- Rectangular cut optimisation (binary splits)
\- Projective likelihood estimator
\- Multi-dimensional likelihood estimator (PDE range-search)
\- Linear discriminant analysis (H-Matrix and Fisher discriminant)
\- Artificial neural networks (three different implementations)
\- Boosted/bagged decision trees (with pruning)
\- Predictive learning via rule ensembles (RuleFit)
\- Support Vector Machine (development version)
