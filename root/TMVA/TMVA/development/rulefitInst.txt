Instructions on how to use the interface to J.Friedmans RuleFit
===============================================================

1. Create a working directory

   mkdir rulefit

2. Get rf_go.exe from Jeromes homepage from

   wget http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~jhf/r-rulefit/linux/rf_go.exe

   and move this into the rulefit dir.


Now it should work with "Use_RuleFitJF = 1".
Options are given in MethodRuleFitJF::DeclareOptions().

For documentation on the options, see:
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~jhf/r-rulefit/RuleFit_help.html#rulefit

Note that I haven't yet made a method that reads the model produced.
Hence, it will only work properly for the training and testing within devTMVA.
