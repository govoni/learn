### first, make sure the HEAD of TMVA-CVS is what we want in the ROOT release !


### this is a temporary directory in which we will create all necessary files for Rene
mkdir TMVAintoROOT; cd TMVAintoROOT 

# we compile against the head of root
svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk root

### Now get the CVS-HEAD of TMVA
setenv CVS_RSH ssh
### next line, use your account name
cvs -d:ext:stelzer@tmva.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tmva co -P TMVA
cd TMVA

### now the files from TMVA are copied over two ROOT/tmva (src/inc/test dirs)
### ( if you think something is missing, please modify the script 'makeROOTpackage.sh'
### so that it is fixed for the next time )
./development/makeROOTpackage.sh ../root 

### now we prepare the cvs diff
cd ../root
 
# !!
# !! Here you need to check if there are any old file in tmva/src
# !! and tmva/inc that are not part of ROOT any longer
# !! 

# find the differences with respect to the HEAD of root/tmva
svn diff tmva > TMVA.diff

# in the new files the cvs id needs to be reset
myreplaceline '\/\/ @(#)root\/tmva ' '// @(#)root/tmva $\Id$' `grep '^\?' TMVA.diff | awk '{print $2}'`

# in case of chosing option 2) above,
# now is the time to compile and
# make sure it works
./configure
make all-tmva

# only if this was successful one should go ahead

### Only if there are new files, they have to be tar'd separately
### ( The following command identifies all new files by the leading ?
### in TMVA.diff and than archives them into TMVAnalysis.tar )
### NOTE: this command is for [t]csh
tar -cvf TMVAnewfiles.tar `grep '^\?' TMVA.diff | awk '{print $2}'`

### both files, 'TMVA.diff' and 'TMVAnewfiles.tar', have to be sent to Rene

### after that you can delete the directory

### cd ../../; rm -r TMVAintoROOT

### Good night
